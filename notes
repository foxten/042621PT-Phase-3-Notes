    - Questions everyone has about the shift to backend development:
        - How much more difficult is Ruby compared to React?
            - More in line with learning JavaScript than React. Won't necessarily be more/less difficult, but it will be different. There are similarities between 
              Ruby and JavaScript that you'll notice. 

        - Is the rest of the bootcamp going to focus on Ruby?
            - Ruby, then Rails (a framework for Ruby).
    
        - Why did Flatiron choose Ruby?
            - No clue. 

    - What is Ruby?
        - Object oriented language
        - Backend language

    - Let's define the following terms, and identify their JS counterparts
        - puts/print --> console.log()/line break provided for each puts statement
        - pp --> 'pretty printing'/use when logging hashes to the console
        - p --> print + inspect 
        - nil --> null & undefined 

    - What is a method?
        - Ruby's version of functions (to reference JavaScript)
        - Methods implicitly return the last line of code 
            -If there's nothing, our return is 'nil'
    
    - Booleans
        - What values are considered falsy in Ruby? (Hint: There are only two (2)!)
            - False & Nil 

    - Variable Declaration
        - snake_cased 
        - scoped differently than JS variables
            - declared wherever they're supposed to live
                - if declared outside of a method, they cannot be used in the method
                    - can be passed in as a argument, but that's it

    - Operators
        - === !== (JS) / == != (Ruby)

    - Conditionals
        - if statement  
            - Ruby: if condition
                        execute this  
                    end 
        - if/elsif/else
            - JS: if (condition) { block } else if (anotherCondition) { block } else { block }
            - Ruby: if condition 
                        execute this
                    elsif another_condition
                        execute this instead
                    else 
                        execute this 
                    end 
        
        - unless
            - the opposite of an 'if' statement!

        - case statements  
            - JS switch statements
                - case thing_to_evaluate
                  when some_condition_is_met 
                    execute this
                  when some_other_condition_is_met
                    execute this
                  else
                    execute this
                  end 

        - statement modifiers!
            - if and unless!
